speaker: Pascal Ehrlich
speakerInfo: |
  I started working in game development almost six years ago. Starting in a marketing role, I've worked my way through numerous production positions, and currently serve as a level artist/designer. The variety of positions I've held has allowed me to see game production from many different perspectives, which is a huge help in my current design and art tasks.[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-ehrlich/)
