  I’m a veteran game designer and marketing manager with 10+ years of self-publishing experience. I contributed to the commercial success of Black Eye Games, an indie bootstrap studio that released 3 games, selling over 1,000,000 copies in total. I continue sharing my expertise with game development studios and indie startups.

  It’s never been easier to create and publish a video game. But reaching commercial success – that’s a different tale. When should you go with a publisher and when for self-publishing? How to use Steam’s extensive promotion tools to squeeze as much as possible out of it? What release strategy should you choose, and how to measure its success? This talk will guide you through the nuances, opportunities, and risks of doing it your way.
